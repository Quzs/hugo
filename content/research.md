## Overview
My undergraduate research project focuses on studying iterated monodromy groups (IMGs) of expanding Thurston maps, under the supervision of Prof. [Zhiqiang Li](http://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/lizq/) (PKU) and Prof. [Tianyi Zheng](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~tiz161/)) (UCSD). This project lies at the intersection of dynamical systems, geometric group theory, and probability.

Here is a [slide](/pdfs/research/IMG.pdf) that was presented during my undergraduate research thesis defense, providing a detailed overview of this research project.
## Key Results
We proved that the random walk on the infinite Schreier graph of an IMG of an expanding Thurston map is almost surely recurrent. This result was achieved through:
- Constructing geometric realizations of finite-level Schreier graphs using tile structures
- Extending these realizations to infinite levels via solenoids
- Applying Benjamini-Schramm's theory on local convergence of planar graphs

## Methods and Techniques
Our approach combines various mathematical tools:
- Tile structure analysis of expanding Thurston maps
- Solenoid theory from Lyubich and Minsky's work on laminations
- Geometric measure theory for compatible measures on solenoids
- Local convergence theory of planar graphs

## Current Status
The project is ongoing, with our immediate goals including:
- Strengthening the recurrence result
- Investigating the amenability of these groups
- Exploring connections to low-dimensional topology
