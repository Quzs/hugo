# About Me

I am Zhengbo Qu, an undergraduate Mathematics major at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn) with passion for mathematical research. 

I am interested in a range of fields, including dynamical systems, low-dimensional topology, geometric group theory and hyperbolic geometry. I am fascinated by the deep connections between these fields, particularly how dynamical techniques illuminate problems in topology and group theory. 

In the section [Research](/research), I provide a brief overview of my current research project.

In the section [Notes](/notes), I share some of my notes on various topics in mathematics, 
some of which are based on final projects for courses I have taken and some are based on my talks at seminars.

Here is my [CV](/pdfs/cv.pdf).
